            I took the concept of a Sports Poll website and tried to build a easy to use and simple experience around the whole thing. My goals for the project, which were numerous, included building a simple, functional and effective polling web app across various user devices.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            And, while doing so, learn and gain experience on new front-end tools and technologies like React, Flux, ES6, Gulp.js, Webpack, Node.js and friends. Which was a tall order from the get go, since until this project, I had only read about some of these but never actually used any of them before.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now admittedly, it was not easy to learn and pick up all these new tools simultaneously while developing a project, but other than Webpack and Gulp.js which were the most troublesome of the bunch. The rest, were relatively manageable.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Thankfully, for the backend I decided to stick with what I know well and develop the API for the web app in Ruby on Rails 4 with MongoDB as the database server.
          </p>

          <p>
            Though, since this project was mostly about building a front-end web app interfacing with a few API endpoints. There really wasn't that much to do in the backend. So, I decided to keep the backend simple and minimal.
          </p>

          <p>
            I did got stuck on a few issues, which took some time to solve. But, they were all related to the Webpack and Gulp.js asset pipeline. Fortunately, there weren't any issues that caused much trouble and stop my progress while developing the web app, itself.
          </p>

          <p>
            There was a lot more that I wanted to do. But, had to skip and take some shortcuts because of time constrains. Things like unit tests, proper error handling on both the front and backend, progress indicators across the UI when loading data, better transitions between UI states, performance optimizations for database queries and loading assets among other things.
          </p>

          <p>
            Which, is fine. After all, <em>Sports Poll</em> is only meant to be a functioning proof, nothing more. And, it does its job admirably at that, and then some.
